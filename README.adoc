= README for FTY

FTY is a "dispatcher" repository which links (as "git submodules") to the
repositories used to build the 42ITy(TM) project. This includes some third
party projects (git HEADs), forks of third-party projects customized for
42ITy(TM) needs, and of course lots of original development.

For a rebuild from scratch (to be automated) you'd need:

* `gsl` and `zproject` (optional -- to refresh project definitions)
* `libzmq`
* `libczmq`
* `malamute`
* `cxxtools`
* `tntdb`
* `fty-proto`
* other `fty-*` components as needed and possibly with dependencies on
  each other as defined in their `profile.xml` manifests for `zproject`
* `fty-core` and `fty-rest` possibly come last
