= README for FTY

FTY is a "dispatcher" repository which links (as "git submodules") to the
repositories used to build the 42ITy(TM) project. This includes some third
party projects (git HEADs), forks of third-party projects customized for
42ITy(TM) needs, and of course lots of original development.
